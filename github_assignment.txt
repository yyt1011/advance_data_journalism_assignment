This repository contains the data used to make the excel sheet of Catholics in the United States. The data were processed with Python and were broken down by Diocese, State, Diocesan Priests, Religious Priests, etc. In the process.py file, the reporter imported agate to set a table, reforming the data from a one csv file to a clearer new csv file. He also did some calculation when making the new file. The coding of this project is clear and easy to understand once I searched the usage of agate and proof. Agate is a really powerful and handy, but the way dictionary works is hard for me to understand. And I didn't find the rules of how the rows lay out. The output of this program were not in the repository, where a csv file named Dioceses6515states seemed to be the right one, but it didn't have rows named "1965_per_capita".
Though basic, this coding file shows me what reporters can do with the help of Python in cleaning and calculating numbers.
This set of data was last edited three years ago, but the numbers themselves and the idea of how to present and make sense of these data are still safe and clear. It will be better if the raw data and the processed data could be displayed clearly in the repository.
